# Code Smells

Duplicated Code, long function, bad comments (too many), unclear variable names, speculative generality(start function)

Refactored: renamed variables to descriptive names to clearly identify the purpose of each variable, created for each loop to implement each button (made code data oriented),deleted redundant start() function that may have been useful on later iterations but unecessarily creates another function, removed unnecessary comments to improve code readability
